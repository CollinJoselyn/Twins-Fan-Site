	<h1>Twins offseason needs</h1>
	<h2>By: Collin Joselyn</h2>
	<h3 id="date"></h3>
	<p>
	The Twins are coming off a pretty successful year. After losing 103 games
	in 2016, they turned it around and made it to the playoffs as 
	the second wildcard team. Despite losing to the Yankees again, Twins
	fans are excited about this team again. Offensively the team was terrific. This 
	roster is full of good young position players. But the biggest hole in this roster is 
	the starting pitching. The Twins have been lacking a strong pitching ace since they
	traded Johan Santana. For free agents the Twins should try to go for Yu Darvish. Darvish
	has been a good pitcher for the Rangers and Dodgers. He posted an impressive WHIP of 1.16 this
	year. Another free agent pitcher that would be a good addition would be Alex Cobb. Cobb in 2017
	had an ERA of 3.66 and a WHIP of 1.22. The Twins should also consider trading for a pitcher. Their possible
	options would be Chris Archer of the Rays. Archer last year posted a WHIP of 1.25. If the Twins 
	want to be serious contenders that can go past the opening round, they will need a good starting pitcher
	 added to the roster.
