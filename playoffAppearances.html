	In 2002 the Twins made it to the playoffs for the first time since
	1991. The twins were almost contracted that year. They played the heavily favored Oakland Athletics, who won 103 games. 
	The Twins were the youngest team in the league that year. They beat the Athletics in 5 games and 
	advanced to the ALCS to face the angels. They would lose to the Angels in 5 games.
	</p>

	<h1>2003</h1>

	<p>
	2003 was the beginning of the Twins and Yankees rivalry. If you can call it that, since the Yankees
	always end up winning. The Twins won the first game of the series, then lost the last three.
	</p>
	</div>
	
	<div class="square">
	<h1>2004</h1>

	<p>
	2004 ALDS was just like the 2003 series. The Twins would lose in four games to the Yankees.
	Game 1 went great for the Twins, Johan Santana threw a complete game shutout. Game 2 the Twins lost 
	a close game that went into extra innings. Game 3 did not go well they struggled on both sides of the ball.
	Game 4 went well until the 8th inning. Johan Santana threw 7 shutout innings and was brought out of the game
	for Juan Rincon. Bernie williams hit a RBI single to score a run. The four run 8th inning for the Yankees 
	brought pure silence into the metrodome. Then later that inning with 2 players on 
	base, Reuben Sierra hit a three run home run to tie the game. Then later on the Twins would go on to lose in 
	the 11th inning and be eliminated from the playoffs.
	</p>

	<h1>2006</h1>
	<img src="pictures/alds06.jpg" alt="2006 ALDS picture" />
	<img src="pictures/alds06_2.jpg" alt="2006 ALDS picture" />
	<p>
	2006 was suppose to be the year the Twins win the world series. They had Johan Santana, a CY young award winner. Justin Morneau 
	the MVP winner and Joe mauer the batting champ. We had all the pieces in place. We were facing the Oakland athletics and we
	had home field advantage. We completely choked. The twins ended up getting swepted. This would go down as 
	one of the most disappointing moments in Minnesota sports history.
	</p>

	<div class="square">
	<h1>2009</h1>
	<img src="pictures/alds09.jpg" alt="2009 ALDS picture" />

	<p>
	2009 the Twins barely made it to the playoffs. They were seven games out of first in the beginning of September.
	They forged a huge comeback and beat the Detroit Tigers in a one game playoff, which was the greatest game 
	I have ever watched. The Twins again got sweeped by the Yankees. Got blown out the first game. The second game
	Joe Nathan blew a save in the nineth inning by giving up a homerun to Alex Rodriguez. Then in the 12th inning
	Mark texeria hit a walk off homerun. Then in game 3 the twins lost 4 to 1.
	</p>

	<h1>2010</h1>
	<img src="pictures/alds10.jpg" alt="2010 ALDS picture" />
	<img src="pictures/alds10_2.jpg" alt="2010 ALDS picture" />
	<p>
	2010 was another disappointing series againt New York. The Twins had home field advantage and had a 
	great offensive team. But mediore pitching came back to bite us. Game one we had a three run lead going
	into the fifth inning. Franscico Liriano was throwing a shutout. All was going well but then the Yankees scored
	four runs effortlessly. This knocked the wind out of me and all Twins fans sails. We thought things would be 
	different this year but instead it was all the same. Twins got sweeped by the Yankees for the second year in a row.
