	The 1987 World Series was the 84th edition of Major League Baseball's championship series, 
	and the conclusion of the 1987 Major League Baseball season. It was a best-of-seven playoff 
	played between the American League (AL) champion Minnesota Twins and the National League (NL) 
	champion St. Louis Cardinals. The Twins defeated the Cardinals four games to three to win the 
	Series. Twins pitcher Frank Viola was named as the 1987 World Series MVP.

	Minnesota was victorious in a World Series that was both the first to feature games played indoors, 
	as well as the first in which the home team won every game. This happened again in 1991 (also a Twins championship)
	over the Atlanta Braves and in 2001 with the Arizona Diamondbacks defeating the New York Yankees.

	The World Series win was the first for the Twins franchise since 1924, when the team was located in
	Washington, D.C., and was known as the Washington Senators.

	The 1991 World Series pitted the American League (AL) champion Minnesota Twins (95–67) against the National 
	League (NL) champion Atlanta Braves (94–68). The Twins defeated the Braves four games to three to win the championship.
	ESPN selected it as the "Greatest of All Time" in their "World Series 100th Anniversary" countdown, with five of its games 
	being decided by a single run, four games decided in the final at-bat and three games going into extra innings.

	In addition to the suspense of the outcome of many of its games, the Series had other highlights. For example, the series-deciding 
	seventh game was a scoreless tie (0–0) through the regular nine innings, and went into extra innings; Minnesota won the seventh 
	game by a score of 1-0 in the 10th inning, with their starting pitcher, Jack Morris, pitching all ten innings. (Morris was named 
	Most Valuable Player for the Series.)

	With 69 innings in total, the 1991 World Series holds the record for longest seven-game World Series ever (some of the early 
	years had nine-game Series, extending longer).
