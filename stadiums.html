	<h1>Metropolitan Stadium</h1>
	<img src="pictures/metropolitan.jpg" alt="metropolitan stadium photo"/>
	<p>
	Metropolitan Stadium is the original home of the Minnesota Twins. It opened April 21, 1961.
	Often refered to as "The Met", was located in Bloomington, MN. The Met was designed by Osborn Engineering. It was also home 
	to the Minnesota Vikings. It closed on September 30, 1981. For several years the stadium sat empty before being demolished in January 1985.
	The site was redeveloped and is now the location of the Mall of America. Inside the mall, 
	a plaque marks the location of homeplate and a red chair bolted along a wall marks Harmon Killebrews 520 foot homerun in 1967.
	The original capacity was 18,200 but later on the capacity was
	increased to 45,919. The Vikings played their last game on December 20, 1981, 
	dropping a 10-6 decision to the Kansas City Chiefs. Fans, sensing that this was the final game of any sort at 
	the stadium, were more determined to claim souvenirs. In preparation, the Vikings tripled their security force for the contest. In the game's final minutes, many of the 41,110 fans 
	in attendance began dismantling seats and bleachers, and thousands stormed the field once the game ended.The goal posts were torn down, pieces of sod from the field were dug up,
	and speakers and lightbulbs on the scoreboard were removed.Hundreds of injuries were reported, mostly minor scrapes and bruises but also multiple 
	head injuries sustained during the melee.

	<p>
	The Metrodome was the second stadium the Twins called home. It opened on April 3, 1982. 
	It was located on 900 South 5th Street in Minneapolis, Minnesota. 
	The Twins played in the Metrodome for 27 seasons. It was also home to the Minnesota Vikings
	and the Minnesota Golden Gophers. The Minnesota Timberwolves played in the metrodome briefly
	during their innugeral season. The metrodome originally had astroturf surface then after 2003 
	the surface was swithed to fieldturf. The stadium had a fiberglass fabric roof that was self-supported by air pressure.
	The roof famously callapsed in 2010 after a big snow storm. The stadiums capacity was 56,144. The Twins played their 
	last game at the Metrodome on October 11, 2009, losing to the New York Yankees in the 
	division round of the playoffs. The Metrodome remained the home to the Minnesota Vikings until after the 2013 NFL season.<br />

	<h1>Target Field</h1>
	<img src="pictures/targetField.jpg" alt="target field photo" />
	<p>
	Target Field is the current home of the Twins. It opened on April 12, 2010.
	Target Field is located in downtown Minneapolis, in the Warehouse District. The capacity is 
	39,029. The battle to build Target Field lasted over a decade, as the Twins struggled to receive funding for construction from the State of 
	Minnesota. Talks of contracting the team by MLB, relocation and passionate support from fans finally led state legislature to approve financing 
	for the ballpark in May 2006.
	The Twins played two preseason games against the St. Louis Cardinals on April 2 and 3, while the stadiums 
	inaugural regular season game was on April 12, 2010 against the Boston Red Sox.
	In 2010, ESPN The Magazine ranked Target Field as the number 1 baseball stadium experience in North America.<br />
