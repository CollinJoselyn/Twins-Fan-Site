	<h1>Early History</h1>
	<img src="pictures/senators.png" alt="washington senators logo" />
	<p>
	Before the they were the Minnesota Twins, they were the Washington Senators from 1901-1960. 
	The Senators moved and were replaced with an expansion Senators team for 1961. The old Washington Senators 
	became the new Minnesota Twins. 
	</p>
	<p>
	The name "Twins" derives from the popular name of the region, the Twin Cities. Knowing about the bitter century-long 
	rivalry between Minneapolis and St. Paul, Griffith was determined not to alienate fans in either city by naming the 
	team after one city or the other. Instead, he proposed to name his team the Twin Cities Twins. However, 
	after a meeting with state officials, a decision then unprecedented in American professional baseball was made. The 
	team would be named after its home state and became known as the Minnesota Twins on November 26, 1960.
	</p>
	<p>
	However, the original "Twin Cities Twins" TC logo was kept until 1987, when the Twins adopted their current 
	uniforms. By this time, the Twins felt they were established enough that they could place an "M" on their caps 
	without making St. Paul think it stood for Minneapolis. The "TC" logo returned to one version of the home uniforms 
	in 2002, as did the team's original cartoon logo: two players representing the area's two minor league teams displaced 
	by the Twins the Minneapolis Millers and St. Paul Saints shaking hands over the Mississippi River, which runs between 
	the two cities. The Twins have returned to the classic "TC" logo on all uniforms for the 2014 season.

	The Twins were eagerly greeted in Minnesota when they arrived in 1961. They brought a nucleus of talented 
	players: Harmon Killebrew, Bob Allison, Camilo Pascual, Zoilo Versalles, Jim Kaat, Earl Battey, and Lenny Green. 
	Tony Oliva, who would go on to win American League batting championships in 1964, 1965 and 1971, made his major league 
	debut in 1962. That year, the Twins won 91 games, the most by the franchise since 1933.
	The Twins of manager Sam Mele won 102 games and the American League Pennant in 1965, driven by the 
	exciting play of superstar slugger Killebrew and batting champion Oliva, the 21 pitching victories by Mudcat Grant, 
	and the flashy play of league MVP Zoilo Versalles. However, they were defeated in the 1965 World Series by the Los Angeles 
	Dodgers in seven games; each home team had won until Game 7, when Sandy Koufax shut out the Twins 2 0 in Minnesota. The 
	Twins scored a total of two runs in their four losses, and were shut out three times, twice by Koufax. Although disappointed
	with the near-miss, the championship drive cemented the team's relationship with the people of Minnesota. The Twins would wait 22 
	years to return to the World Series; they defeated the St. Louis Cardinals in seven games in the 1987 Series.

	<p>
	The team continued to post winning records through 1971, winning the first two American League West division titles. 
	However, they then entered a decade-long slump, finishing around .500 for the next eight years. Tony Oliva and Rod Carew 
	continued to provide offensive power, but Killebrew's home run production decreased, as injuries impacted his effectiveness, 
	and the pitching staff languished. Killebrew's final season with the Twins was the 1974 season.
	Owner Calvin Griffith faced financial difficulty with the start of free agency. While other owners had fortunes made in 
	other businesses, Griffith's only income came from baseball. He ran the Twins as a family-owned business, employing many 
	family members, and had to turn a profit each season. Stars Lyman Bostock and Larry Hisle left as free agents after the 1977 season 
	and prompted the trade of Rod Carew after the 1978 season.

	<h1>1980s</h1>
	<img src="pictures/eighties.jpg" alt="1987 world series" />
	<p>
	In the early 1980s, The Twins fell further, winning only 37% of its games from 1981 to 1982. They had their worst 
	season in Minnesota in 1982, with a 60–102 record, the worst the franchise had since the 1904 season (that team went 38–113). 
	It was the first (and last until 2016) 100-loss season in Minnesota. From their arrival in 1961 through 1981, the team played its 
	games at Metropolitan Stadium in Bloomington, a suburb south of the Twin Cities. The Mall of America now occupies the spot where the 
	"Old Met" stood, complete with home plate and the seat where Harmon Killebrew hit a 520-foot home run; both of those landmarks are located 
	inside of Nickelodeon Universe. The 1982 season brought the team indoors, into Hubert H. Humphrey Metrodome, which was located in downtown 
	Minneapolis near the Mississippi River.
	In 1984, Calvin Griffith sold the Twins to Minneapolis banker Carl Pohlad. In 1985, Minnesota hosted the All-Star Game at Metrodome, with 
	the National League winning the game 6-1 over the American League. Future World Series MVP Jack Morris was the losing pitcher for the American League.
	After several losing seasons in the Dome, a nucleus of players acquired during the waning years of the Griffith regime (Kent Hrbek, Tom Brunansky, 
	Gary Gaetti, Frank Viola) combined with a few good trades (Bert Blyleven), intelligent free agent acquisitions (Al Newman, Roy Smalley), and a rising 
	star in Kirby Puckett, combined to return the team to the World Series for the first time since 1965, defeating the Detroit Tigers (who won the World 
	Series three years earlier) in the ALCS along the way. The dynamic play of the new superstars electrified the team and propelled the Twins to a seven-game 
	victory over the St. Louis Cardinals to win the 1987 World Series. All games in the 1987 series were won by the home team.
	The 1987 Twins set a record for fewest regular season victories by a World Series champion with 85 and a .525 winning percentage. This record 
	was broken by the 2006 Cardinals, who won the World Series after going 83–78 during the regular season and a .513 percentage. While their 56–25 
	record at Metrodome was the best overall home record for 1987, the Twins had an appalling 29–52 mark away from Metrodome and they only won nine road games after the All-Star break.
	The Twins won more games in 1988, but could not overcome the powerhouse division rival Oakland Athletics (who in turn lost the 1988 World 
	Series to the Los Angeles Dodgers), even though pitcher Frank Viola won the Cy Young Award in that year. 1989 saw a decline in the win column 
	although Puckett would win the batting title that season.

	<p>
	The Twins surprisingly did quite poorly in 1990, finishing last in the AL West division with a record of 74–88, 29 games behind 
	the Athletics, the eventual World Series runner-up. 1991 brought breakout years from newcomers Shane Mack, Scott Leius, Chili Davis, 
	and rookie of the year Chuck Knoblauch, along with consistently excellent performances from stars Hrbek and Puckett. The pitching staff 
	excelled as well, with 20-game winner Scott Erickson, closer Rick Aguilera, and newly acquired free agent, St. Paul native Jack Morris, having 
	all-star years. The Twins defeated the Toronto Blue Jays in five games to win the 1991 ALCS and the Atlanta Braves 4 games to 3 to win the nail-biting 
	1991 World Series, which is considered by many to be the greatest of all time.[11] Game 6 is widely considered to be one of the greatest World Series 
	games ever played. Facing elimination, and with the score tied 3-3 in the bottom of the 11th inning, Kirby Puckett stepped up to the plate and drove the 
	game-winning home run into the left field seats to force a decisive Game 7. The home run was Puckett's only walk-off home run of his career. In the final 
	and deciding game, Jack Morris pitched a 10-inning shutout, viewed by many baseball historians as one of the greatest pitching performances in a 7th game 
	of the World Series, to beat the Braves 1–0 and bring home the championship to Minnesota. 1991 was considered to be the first season that any team that ended 
	in last place the previous year advanced to the World Series; both the Twins and Braves accomplished the unprecedented feat. ESPN rated the 1991 World Series 
	as the best ever played in a 2003 centennial retrospective of the World Series. As with the 1987 World Series, which the Twins also won, all 7 games were won by the home team.

	The Twins were the first World Series champion to lose three away games and still win the series by winning all four home games; doing it in 1987 and again in 1991. 
	The Arizona Diamondbacks duplicated this feat in 2001, when they became the first National League team to do so.

	1992 saw another superb Athletic team that the Twins could not overcome, despite a 90–72 season and solid pitching from John Smiley. After that season, the Twins 
	again fell into an extended slump, posting a losing record each year for the next eight years: 71–91 in 1993, 50–63 in 1994, 56–88 in 1995, 78–84 in 1996, 68–94 
	in 1997, 70–92 in 1998, 63–97 in 1999 and 69–93 in 2000. From 1994 to 1997 a long sequence of retirements and injuries hurt the team badly, and Tom Kelly spent 
	the remainder of his managerial career attempting to rebuild the Twins.
	</p>

	<p>
	Puckett after the 1995 season was forced to retire at age 35 due to loss of vision in one eye from a central retinal vein occlusion. He retired as the Twins
	all-time leader in career hits, runs, doubles, and total bases. At the time of his retirement, his .318 career batting average was the highest by any right 
	handed American League batter since Joe DiMaggio. Puckett was the fourth baseball player during the 20th century to record 1,000 hits in his first five full 
	calendar years in Major League Baseball, and was the second to record 2,000 hits during his first ten full calendar years. He was elected to the Baseball 
	Hall of Fame in 2001, his first year of eligibility.

	In 1997, owner Carl Pohlad almost sold the Twins to North Carolina businessman Don Beaver, who would have moved the team to the Piedmont Triad 
	(Greensboro–Winston-Salem–High Point) area of the state. The defeat of a referendum for a stadium in that area and a lack of interest in building
	a stadium for the Twins in Charlotte killed the deal. In 1998, management cleared out the team of all of its players earning over 1 million dollars 
	(except for pitcher Brad Radke) and rebuilt from the ground up; the team barely avoided finishing in last place that year, finishing just five games
	ahead of the Tigers and avoiding the mark of 100 losses by eight games.

	<p>
	Things turned around, and from 2001 to 2006, the Twins compiled the longest streak of consecutive winning seasons since moving to Minnesota, 
	going 85–77 in 2001, 94–67 in 2002, 90–72 in 2003, 92–70 in 2004, 83-79 in 2005, and 96–66 in 2006. From 2002 to 2004, the Twins compiled their 
	longest streak of consecutive league/division championships ever (previous were the 1924 World Champion-1925 AL Champion Senators and the 1969–70 Twins). 
	Threatened with closure by league contraction (along with the Montreal Expos) in 2002, the team battled back to reach the ALCS before being eliminated 4-1 
	by that year's eventual World Series champion Anaheim Angels. Their streak of three straight division titles, along with some bitterly fought games, have 
	helped to create an intense rivalry with the Chicago White Sox in recent years, starting with 2000 when the Sox clinched the division at Metrodome, and 
	heating up especially in 2003, 2004, 2005 and 2008.

	<p>
	In 2006, the Twins came from 12 games back in the division at the All-Star break to tie the Detroit Tigers for the lead in the 159th game of the season.
	With the Tigers having won the season head-to-head by 11 games to 8, the Twins needed a Tiger loss and a Twins win in order to take sole possession of first 
	place and win the division outright, and got both on the last day of the season, when the Tigers lost their third straight game at home to the last place Kansas 
	City Royals in a 10–8 game in 12 innings. After their win against the Chicago White Sox, the Minnesota Twins and somewhere between 30,000 and 40,000 fans watched 
	the Tigers-Royals game on Metrodomes jumbotrons. This was the first time in major league history that a team has won a division or league outright on the last 
	day of the regular season without ever having had sole possession of first place earlier. The magical season came to a sudden end, however, as the Twins were swept 
	3–0 by Oakland in the divisional championship series, while Detroit went on as a wild card entry, beat the Yankees 3–1 in their divisional series, and went on to play 
	the A s. The Tigers would sweep the A's 4–0 in the ALCS and lose the 2006 World Series to the St. Louis Cardinals, who coincidentally broke the record held by the Twins
	for the worst regular season record by a World Series champion (having gone 83–79).
