	<h1>2017 Draft Thoughts</h1>
	<h2>By: Collin Joselyn</h2>
	<h3 id="date"></h3>
	<p>
	The 2017 first year player draft was a big opportunity for the Twins.
	They were getting the first overall pick, the first time since 2001 that they 
	got the first overall pick. Going into the draft I was certain that the Twins would 
	pick Hunter Greene, pitcher out of Notre Dame High School in California, with a 102 mph
	fastball. But instead they shocked everyone and picked Royce Lewis, a shortstop from  
	JSerra Catholic High School in San Juan Capistrano, California. This was shocking because Royce was
	not even predicted to go in the top 10. I was kind of skeptical of this because we have the first pick 
	so lets get the best available player. We are also in need of an ace. I understand the risk of drafting pitchers 
	in the first round because their arms do not last long. We already have an abundant supply of good position players.
	This organization is afraid to pull the trigger and draft a pitcher. Possibly because our minor league system
	has failed to develop an ace. For example guys like Kyle Gibson and Alex Wimmers were first round picks for the 
	Twins. They have not lived up to expectations. Kyle Gibson was aweful in the biggining of 2017 but then turned it 
	around later in the season after being designated for assignment and later brought back. Once thought of a being our
	next pitching ace, is now mainly considered a 4th or 5th man in the rotation. But in conclusion we will have to 
	wait for the future to come and see how Hunter and Royce turn out.
